      question: "Do I need to Bring A Life Jacket?",
      answer: `There are adult and children life jackets on the boat, however they are very bulky so if you have one that your child likes feel free to bring it along. The life jackets must be Coast Guard approved.

    },
    {
      question: "What About Tipping?",
